kdevtmpfsi

The solution mentioned here worked for us. You basically create the files the miner uses, without any rights, so the miner cannot create and use them. https://github.com/docker-library/redis/issues/217

touch /tmp/kdevtmpfsi && touch /var/tmp/kinsing

echo "everything is good here" > /tmp/kdevtmpfsi

echo "everything is good here" > /var/tmp/kinsing

touch /tmp/zzz

echo "everything is good here" > /tmp/zzz

chmod go-rwx /var/tmp

chmod 1777 /tmp
